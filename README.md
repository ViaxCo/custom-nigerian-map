# Custom Nigerian SVG map

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a responsive vector image of the Nigerian map that would have some custom functionality when hovering over some regions.

## Features

- Show all states in Nigeria.
- Add hover actions to show more information about a state (kind of like a tooltip)

**Demo:** [Custom Nigerian Map](https://viaxco.github.io/custom-nigerian-map/)
